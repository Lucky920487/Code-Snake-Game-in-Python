# Code-Snake-Game-in-Python
This is a simple Snake Game made using Python's tkinter. The snake moves in a grid, eats red food to grow, and the game ends if it hits the wall or itself. Arrow keys control the direction. The score increases with each food eaten. The game updates every 100 ms, and "Game Over" is shown when the snake crashes.
