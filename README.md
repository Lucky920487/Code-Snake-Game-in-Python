# Code-Snake-Game-in-Python
This is a simple Snake Game made using Python's tkinter. The snake moves in a grid, eats red food to grow, and the game ends if it hits the wall or itself. Arrow keys control the direction. The score increases with each food eaten. The game updates every 100 ms, and "Game Over" is shown when the snake crashes.

## 🧠 Algorithmic Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Greedy Strategy** | Snake eats food as soon as it finds it |
| ✅ **Simulation** | Snake moves frame by frame, updated every 100 ms |
| ✅ **Randomization** | Food appears at a random location |
| ✅ **Brute Force** | Collision detection with walls and snake’s body |
| ✅ **Event-driven Programming** | Arrow key control via keyboard events |
| ✅ **Looping & Conditions** | For updating snake body and checking game status |
